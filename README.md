## Usage
<p>Apollo is a portable application, so all you have to do to start it is to run the executable file you either downloaded or built.<br>
The Apollo GUI will be automatically opened in your default browser. If for some reason it doesn't open, you can access it by going to either <code>http://127.0.0.1:5000</code> or <code>http://localhost:5000</code>
<br>
<br>
Before usage, you will need to set your Spotify developer Client id and Client secret</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard</li>
  <li>Create an app</li>
  <li>Set the redirect URI to https://localhost:5000 (This doesn't really matter but it's required by Spotify)</li>
  <li>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret and input them into Apollo settings</li>
</ol>
